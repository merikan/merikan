## Hi, I‚Äôm Peter Merikan.

[@merikan:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@merikan:matrix.org)

I am a Software Engineer living just outside of Gothenburg, Sweden. I have worked with this craft for over 35 years and still think it is the most fun there is and I am constantly passionate about learning new things.

I currently work for one of Sweden's best IT consulting companies, [Callista Enterprise](https://callistaenterprise.se/). 

My current assignment is at Inera as a solution architect where I am part of a small team building their questionnaire management solution, used in Swedish healthcare. It is a cloud-native solution built with Spring Boot running on Kubernetes.


### My Mottos
* Have fun and always try to make a difference. 
* You are never too old to learn new things.

And don't forget that      
> In software development, 
> complexity might be admired but simplicity is always rewarded.   

Because very often [less is more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism#Minimalist_design_and_architecture), so [keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), be pragmatic and don't over [overengineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering)

## My Journey
In March 1987, I started my IT career as a system administrator at Volvo Dealers Business Systems (Volvohandelns Aff√§rssystem), where we developed and operated systems for Swedish Volvo dealers on IBM AS/400.  

1988 I was persuaded to come to [Volvofinans](https://www.volvofinans.se/) and work as a software developer with their leasing system, soon to be released. I had a great time at Volvofinans working as a software developer, responsible for methods and technology (today we call it CTO ;-)).
For a few years I had been longing to build web systems with java on this awesome thing called The Internet, so I decided to try my wings and become a Java consultant. Said and done, in July 2000 I started working at Frontec as a Java consultant and a whole [new world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1Rb9hC4JY) appeared, Java, Linux, ant, csv.. you name it.

In 2003, a good friend of mine started a new position at Volvofinans as IT manager and he convinced me to come back to the financial world and become their IT architect and that was an easy decision. I was not only responsible for the architecture but also had, among other things, operating environments, network, security, development processes, as my work areas. 
We developed great solutions to support the business and to make the organization more efficient. And as chief architect, I was responsible for the IT solution when we built software solutions to support our business to be compliant with the Basel II requirements and regulations, when we started our journey to a service-oriented architecture and built our first internet bank. Had a fantastic time at Volvofinans with awesome colleagues and a company that is reasonably large and that wants to use IT to find advantages over its competitors.

In 2012, I started to feel the urge to work for a company where IT was the main business and in 2013 I started working at [Callista Enterprise](https://callistaenterprise.se/), which I knew very well since I worked with people from Callista Enterprise for many years and knew how skilled and competent they are.

So here I am at Callista Enterprise, working with large-scale cloud-native systems in Kubernetes at Inera used by Swedish Healthcare and having the time of my life.
